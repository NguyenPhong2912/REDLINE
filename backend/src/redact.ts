// server or it is not masking.

// What stays visible matters as much as what goes. REDLINE's whole claim is
// that a stranger can verify the program refused an over-cap transfer, so
// event types, reason codes, gate numbers, amounts and on-chain signatures are
// kept: a signature is already public on Solana, and without it the evidence
// is unverifiable. What goes is the linkage a stranger has no business
// assembling — which wallet owns which vault, paid whom, how often.
