# REDLINE backend

Off-chain services for REDLINE: REST API, policy engine, agent runtime, log indexer, audit trail and live feed. The chain is the only authority — everything here either *proposes* an action or *records* what the chain decided.

Hosted instance: `https://redline-api-ku3s.onrender.com` (Render web service + Render Postgres, public Devnet RPC). Provisioned from `render.yaml` at the repo root. Program: `Fj7MV8Z2a3RdH4W8VF2XKfWAsWHT3jxhoqGMcmb4WbS4`.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22+ and a Postgres URL (Render/Neon free tier is fine).

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # set DATABASE_URL; CHAIN=mock needs nothing else
npm run db:push
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:8787
```

Smoke-test the six-beat demo (bash + python on PATH):

```bash
bash scripts/demo.sh
```

Expected: three compliant transfers confirmed, the fourth rejected with `SPEND_CAP_EXCEEDED` and counters unchanged, then `REVOKED` after the owner revokes.

## Chain adapters

| `CHAIN=` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `mock` | In-memory program with the same 7 gates and counter updates. Signatures are prefixed `MOCK…`. `MOCK_CLOCK_SPEED=60` makes a 1-minute cooldown pass in 1 second. |
| `solana` | `src/chain/solana.ts` sends real transactions. `execute_transfer` goes out with `skipPreflight` so a rejection lands on-chain as evidence. Retries with backoff on RPC throttling. |

The backend speaks Anchor's wire format without a generated client: `src/chain/anchor.ts` encodes discriminators, Borsh arguments, the `Grant` account layout, error codes and events; `test/anchor.test.ts` pins it. The IDL exported from Solana Playground is in `idl/redline_guardrails.json` for reference.

## Gate order (matches the program)

1 `REVOKED` · 2 `EXPIRED` · 3 `NONCE_REPLAY` · 4 `MINT_NOT_ALLOWED` · 5 `DESTINATION_NOT_ALLOWED` · 6 `TX_CAP_EXCEEDED` / `SPEND_CAP_EXCEEDED` · 7 `COOLDOWN_ACTIVE`

`src/policy/engine.ts` mirrors this order, so a precheck reason code always equals the program error the chain would return (codes 6005–6012).

## API

Identity, in one paragraph. The shared `REDLINE_API_KEY` ships inside the public
frontend bundle, so **anyone can read it** — it keeps drive-by traffic off the
write routes and proves nothing about who is calling. Anything that acts on
someone's property (publishing a build, pricing a listing, renting, reviewing,
granting or revoking authority, starting or stopping a run, topping up a vault)
requires a **wallet session**: the wallet signs a server-issued challenge and the
API checks the signature against the address, which is a raw ed25519 public key.

Reads are scoped the same way. A route that returns one wallet's activity returns
*the caller's*; a stranger gets either an empty set or a redacted projection —
never someone else's wallets, vaults and destinations. See `src/redact.ts` for
what redaction keeps (event type, reason code, amount, on-chain signature — the
evidence) and what it removes (identity and linkage).

A deployment with **no** `REDLINE_API_KEY` has declared itself local or mock:
writes stay open and reads stay unscoped, so `scripts/demo.sh` runs the whole
six-beat demo with no headers.

A session is the real credential: `POST /auth/nonce` returns a challenge naming the wallet and a one-time nonce, the wallet signs those bytes, and `POST /auth/verify` exchanges the signature for a bearer token. A Solana address *is* an ed25519 public key, so the signature verifies against the address itself. Nonces are single-use and expire in 5 minutes; sessions last 12 hours and are stored as a SHA-256 of the token, never the token.

Routes that act on someone's property require a session and accept nothing else:

- `PATCH /listings/:id` — a listing can only be claimed by the wallet that will be paid for it.
- `POST /runs` and `POST /intents` — both make the executor spend from a grant's vault, so both check the caller owns that grant. Without this the shared key alone would let anyone drive someone else's agent up to its cap.

On a deployment with no `REDLINE_API_KEY` these checks stand down: that configuration has already declared itself local or mock, where writes are open and `scripts/demo.sh` runs without a wallet.

`REDLINE_API_KEY` in `x-redline-key` remains as a fallback for the scripted demo and headless callers. It is a drive-by guard, not authentication: it ships to a public frontend and anyone can read it out of the bundle. Owner actions on-chain are authorised by the wallet signature the program verifies, whatever the API thinks.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | chain kind, cluster, program id, executor, build version, indexer state, rate limit, and whether writes require a signature |
| POST | `/auth/nonce` · `/auth/verify` | wallet sign-in: issue a challenge, exchange a signature for a session |
| GET | `/auth/me` | the wallet behind the current session |
| POST | `/agents` | publish an immutable build. **Needs a wallet session** — the publisher is taken from the signature, never from the body. Re-publishing the same bytes from the same wallet is idempotent; a different wallet gets its own row (`agentHash` is unique per publisher) |
| GET | `/agents` · `?mine=true` · `?publisher=` | the catalogue, each row carrying `publisherWallet`, `isMine`, `unclaimed` and its `rating` |
| GET | `/agents/:id` | one build with its listings and reputation |
| POST | `/grants/preflight` | everything `POST /grants` would refuse, answered **before** the wallet signs: rental required (402), wrong wallet (403), unknown agent (404), plus the lifetime clamped to the rental term and the executor to name in `create_grant` |
| POST | `/grants` | record a wallet-signed grant (`grantPda`, `createSignature`, `agentId`, policy). On Solana the account is read back and must name this wallet as owner, this API's executor and the posted policy's hash — a stranger cannot register someone else's grant. An agent someone else published and priced needs a live `hireId` covering it |
| GET | `/grants` | **the caller's** grants with live on-chain state; empty for an anonymous caller |
| GET | `/grants/:id` | full for the owner; redacted for anyone else (`onchain` carries counters and limits only) |
| POST | `/grants/:id/revoke` | record an owner-signed `revoke_grant` (signature required on Solana; refused with 409 while the account still reads active) |
| POST | `/intents/preview` | dry-run the gates; no write, no fee |
| POST | `/intents` | record one intent and submit it only when the current policy precheck allows it |
| GET | `/grants/:id/intents` | intents with decisions and chain transactions; destinations redacted for anyone but the owner |
| POST | `/runs` · `/runs/:id/stop` | start / stop the agent runtime (`mode: scripted | llm`). Runs left `running` by a restart are closed at boot; a run under a rental stops when the rental ends |
| GET | `/grants/:id/feed` | server-sent events (`*` = all grants). Redacted unless the subscriber owns the grant. `EventSource` cannot send headers, so this one route accepts the session token as `?access_token=` |
| GET | `/audit?grant=` | the caller's own trail in full; anonymous callers get a short recent window, redacted, and cannot filter it by grant |
| GET | `/vaults/:owner` | vault PDA, ATA and live balance. Only your own |
| GET | `/listings` · PATCH `/listings/:id` | marketplace listings; the publisher claims one by setting a payout wallet and a 24h rate (write-once wallet) |
| GET | `/listings/:id/reviews` · POST | renter reviews; posting needs a session **and** a rental on that listing, one review per rental |
| GET | `/listings/:id/reviewable` | whether this wallet may review, and which rentals are open |
| GET | `/hires` · POST `/hires` | rental agreements; the SOL payment is fetched from Devnet and checked (signer, payee, rate × 24h periods) before the row is written. A grant for a rented agent records which agreement covers it, and is refused once it lapses |
| GET | `/analytics?owner=` | volume, allowed/blocked counts and decision latency computed from the audit trail |
| GET | `/protocol/overview?owner=` | ordered seven-gate catalog, network state and decision/rejection rollup for the live policy visualization |
| GET | `/policy/presets` | three versioned hypothetical policy configurations for Policy Lab |
| POST | `/policy/simulate` | public, bounded sequential simulation with seven-gate traces; no wallet, database writes or chain calls |
| POST | `/devnet/fund` | mint demo USDC into **your own** vault (Devnet only) |
| POST | `/risk-assess` | AI risk copilot with deterministic floor |
| POST | `/assistant` | answers a question about recorded state; the brief is assembled server-side and is the only fact source the model gets |

Amounts are strings of base units (`"100000000"` = 100 USDC).

Policy Lab input limits, examples, response semantics and Vietnamese user documentation: [docs/POLICY_LAB.md](../docs/POLICY_LAB.md). Run `npm run dev:lab` for an isolated local server on `127.0.0.1:8788` without Postgres or a chain executor. Only the two Policy Lab endpoints are available in this mode; other endpoints explicitly return 503. The normal server includes both new routes automatically, with no schema migration.

`/protocol/overview`, `/analytics` and `/assistant` count a grant as active only while it is neither revoked nor past its window. Each grant carries its own `expiresAt` (mirrored from the program at creation); the `PolicyVersion` row's date is shared by every grant with the same policy shape and is only a fallback for rows written before the column existed.

## Reputation

An agent's standing is two numbers, kept apart on purpose (`src/routes/ratings.ts`).

**Reliability** is derived from records nobody can vote on: the policy decisions
its grants produced (`allowed / decisions`) and what the chain did with the
transfers it was allowed to make (`successes / attempts`). An agent whose
proposals were repeatedly refused has a low compliance rate no matter what its
renters say.

**Reviews** come only from wallets that paid for a rental. `AgentReview.hireId`
is unique, so one rental buys exactly one review — inflating a score means
renting again, which costs real SOL.

The headline `score` (0–100) weights reliability 70 / reviews 30, needs at least
three recorded decisions before the reliability half counts, and is `null` with
neither. An agent with no history is **unrated**, which is not the same as badly
rated — `basis` says which halves the score used.

## Runtime modes

- `scripted` — three paced transfers of 20% of the cap, then stop. Rejection cases run in Policy Lab without fees or failed transactions.
- `llm` — a model proposes an action under a strict JSON schema; the proposal is clamped to the allowlists and judged by the program like any other intent. Needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Transaction requests accept canonical 32-byte Solana addresses and positive base-unit amounts up to `u64::MAX`. `/intents/preview` returns the nonce and exact verdict used by the UI; `/intents` rechecks the live state and never bypasses a denied precheck. The program remains the final authority if chain state changes between those calls.

Both the planner and the risk copilot talk to any OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint (`src/llm-client.ts`). Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to point at one — Groq's free tier needs no card — or leave it unset for OpenAI, which has no free tier. `OPENAI_MODEL` must name a model that endpoint serves; when it does not, the call fails and the copilot answers from the deterministic floor, with the reason logged.

## Indexer

With `CHAIN=solana` the server subscribes to `logsNotifications` for the program. Every transaction that mentions it — ours or anyone's — is decoded: `PolicyDecision` events update mirrored counters and become `chain.policy_decision` audit rows; failed transactions become `chain.tx_failed` with the mapped reason code.

A subscription only delivers what happens while it is open, so on every connect the indexer first replays anything recorded on-chain after the newest signature already in the audit trail (`getSignaturesForAddress`, capped at 1,000). A restart, a dropped socket or a host spin-down therefore leaves no hole in the record. Writes are idempotent per signature, so the overlap between the replay and the live stream is free.

## Tests

```bash
npm test                 # 83 tests including Policy Lab, API boundaries and expired-grant counts
npm run program:fetch    # download the deployed program binary from Devnet
npm run test:onchain     # LiteSVM: 3 allows, nonce replay, spend cap, foreign destination, wrong signer, revoke
```

`test:onchain` needs Linux/macOS (LiteSVM ships no Windows build) and runs in CI on every push (`.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`).

## Deploy (Render)

`render.yaml` at the repo root provisions this service, its Postgres database and the dashboard together — Render → Blueprints → New Blueprint Instance, point it at this repo.

It sets root directory `backend`, Node 22 via `.node-version`, `npm run build` then `npm start` (`prisma db push` + server), health check on `/health`, and wires `DATABASE_URL` from the database. Render injects `PORT`; do not set it.

Render prompts once for the secrets the blueprint marks `sync: false`: `SOLANA_RPC_URL` / `SOLANA_WS_URL` (the public Devnet endpoint works; a dedicated RPC avoids the throttling that shared cloud IPs attract), `EXECUTOR_KEYPAIR_PATH` and `DEMO_OWNER_KEYPAIR_PATH` as the JSON byte arrays themselves (Render has no persistent disk for a key file), `DEMO_USDC_MINT`, `DEMO_OWNER_WALLET`, `DEMO_VAULT_PDA`, `DEMO_OPS_DESTINATION`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`. `REDLINE_API_KEY` is generated by Render.

`EXECUTOR_KEYPAIR_PATH` must be set before the first deploy: `CHAIN=solana` makes `initChain` throw without it and the service will not boot.

The dashboard needs nothing entered by hand — every `VITE_*` value is pulled from this service with `fromService`, so the API key, program ID and demo accounts cannot drift between the two.

## Keys and demo accounts

`npm run devnet:setup` creates the executor and destination keypairs, a demo USDC mint, the vault, and funds it. `executor.json` signs `execute_transfer` and pays its fees. `owner.json` exists only for headless demos and as the demo mint authority; in the product the owner signs in the browser. Never commit keypairs or `.env` (they are gitignored).

## Maintenance

- `npm run db:cleanup` removes intents that never reached a decision (also swept at startup).
- `scripts/withdraw-check.ts` proves the `withdraw` account order against the live program.
