# Three-minute demo script

Everything below is live on Devnet. Nothing on screen is a fixture.

**Before you present.** The API sleeps after ~15 minutes idle on Render's free tier and takes about a minute to wake, so open `https://redline-api-ku3s.onrender.com/health` a few minutes early and leave the dashboard loaded. Have a Devnet wallet connected with a little SOL for fees. If the vault is empty, Treasury → **Refill 1,000 (devnet)**.

Sign in before you start, unless you want to demonstrate it live: the wallet reconnects on its own but a session never does, and starting the agent will otherwise prompt for a signature mid-beat.

## 0:00–0:20 — The problem

Automating a treasury forces a bad choice: approve every transaction by hand, or hand a bot broad wallet authority and hope. And afterwards nobody can prove what the agent was *allowed* to do — only what it did.

State the claim you are about to demonstrate: REDLINE makes the boundary explicit, and a Solana program — not the agent's good behaviour — enforces it.

## 0:20–0:40 — Connect

Connect a Wallet Standard wallet on Devnet. Show the address and SOL balance, then Treasury: the vault PDA, its balance, and the point that the vault is owned by the program, not by the server.

## 0:40–1:20 — Write the policy

Guardrails → wizard. Pick SOL and USDC, a **500 USDC cap**, 25 transactions, 12-hour expiry, and the **1-minute cooldown** — the shortest the wizard offers. The runtime paces itself to the cooldown so it never trips gate 7, so a long one means long silences on stage.

Run the risk assessment. Show the score, the verdict, and the `source` label. Make the design point: deterministic rules set a floor the model can only raise — a BLOCK verdict disables signing, and the model cannot argue a policy down.

`source` tells you which answered. `openai+deterministic-floor` means the model ran and its verdict was reconciled against the floor; `deterministic-fallback` means the call did not land — a free-tier rate limit, usually — and the rules answered alone. If you get the second one live, say so: the copilot is an input, not a dependency, and the policy is judged either way. Running the assessment once or twice before you present makes the first case more likely.

## 1:20–1:40 — Sign it on-chain

**Sign & create on-chain grant.** The wallet signs `create_grant`; the backend only records the resulting PDA and signature. Say plainly: the owner's key never leaves the browser, and the server has no authority to widen this policy afterwards.

## 1:40–2:20 — Validate before moving funds

**Run safe sequence.** The wallet asks for a signature first — not a transaction, a sign-in. Starting a run makes the executor spend from this vault, so the API requires proof that the caller holds the owner's key. Signing costs nothing and moves nothing.

The first transfer then confirms on-chain within seconds; point at the counters rising on the PDA. Say what happens next: the agent waits out its cooldown before proposing again, because the runtime paces itself rather than letting the chain reject it for going too fast.

Use **Send safely** for a single transfer. The interface previews all seven gates, pins the approved nonce and submits only if the verdict is `OK`. The live feed then shows:

```
on-chain ALLOW · transfer confirmed
```

Open the Explorer link to verify the confirmed transfer. Then return to Protocol → Policy Lab, choose an over-budget proposal and show the `SPEND_CAP_EXCEEDED` trace. That comparison demonstrates both paths without charging a fee for a transaction known to fail.

The spend cap is gate 6 and the cooldown is gate 7, so the simulator reports the cap first under the same ordered rules as execution.

Reference, if the live run is slow: [a transfer that was allowed](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5gjTwZeHxddXzeVXEscu9p1tJzNmhYuGZc9dj4EjYt16ZycNCaBjpGazi3uSqVfeLvCftoNjv4kDKteWZLJxRS9h?cluster=devnet). The repository also retains [an earlier on-chain rejection proof](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/t4Xb9MFdFBrw8ndHGc496a6fGbGHmNbB2apvPwYzxt36M2LqLxE9k11zhpoSPV1TChw9iKq4AuoofBx1aAwu9su?cluster=devnet) to verify that the program enforces gate 6.

## 2:20–2:40 — The owner stays in control

**Revoke** from the wallet — the next attempt fails with `Revoked`. Then Treasury → **Withdraw**: no gates apply, because the owner's key is the authority. Show the Audit page: every proposal, decision and signature, appended, with the indexer's own record read back from the program's logs rather than from the server's memory.

## 2:40–3:00 — Close

What is real today: the Anchor program on Devnet, wallet-signed grants, seven gates enforced on every transfer, an audit trail sourced from chain events, marketplace rentals whose SOL payment is verified against the chain, and analytics computed from the trail. P&L and APY are absent on purpose — the system has no price feed, so there is no honest number to show.

Where it goes: treasury teams first, subscription plus marketplace fee. The next technical milestone is DEX adapters with instruction inspection, so agents can trade inside a policy rather than only transfer.

Be direct about scope: Devnet only, no professional audit yet.
